The purpose of this work is to verify circuits described in bit-level VHDL, with the use of formal verification allied to code transformations, seeking to identify the incorrect operation of a particular circuit. The analysis is performed through the manual insertion of assertions to the VHDL code, where transformation and instrumentation of code for tool use with the Bounded Model Checking technique is applied, to explore all achievable states of the circuit and thus determine if the violation occurred described in the assertion inserted into the code. During the initial tests, it was verified that the translation tool presented limits, in order to avoid that more complex circuits could be analyzed and thus restricting the capacity of the method proposed in this work. As future works, it is necessary to search for a new translation tool and also the automatic insertion of assertions, making the method more automatic and as less of a burden of developer interference.
